Release notes for Commons-Pool 1.1
===================================
There were a lot changes since the 1.0.1 release on 12 Aug 2002.
* A lot of corner cases were fixed

* Performance improvement by optimizing pool synchronization,
  the critical code paths were optimized by reducing pool synchronization
  but we also added more synchronization where needed 

* New minIdle feature: the minimum number of objects allowed in the pool
  before the evictor thread (if active) spawns new objects.
  (Note no objects are created when: numActive + numIdle >= maxActive)

* New maxTotal feature: a cap on the total number of instances controlled by a pool.
  Only for GenericKeyedObjectPool where maxActive is a cap on the number of active 
  instances from the pool (per key).

* UML Class & sequence diagrams

* The following issues were resolved since v1.0.1: (see Bugzilla for complete description)
